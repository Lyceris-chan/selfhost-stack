- [x] Not all services are listed on the dashboard e.g scribe is still missing
- [x] im unable to dismiss the update banner and it should be the same width as the category bar same thing goes for the MAC address warning ensure both show up after -c is ran as it shouldnt retain any data
- [x] session auto cleanup toggle looks messed up and clips out the box 
- [x] the text in the System Information chips like update all shouldnt be two rows and all other chips have their text cut off 
- [x] saying status unknown or certificate missing is incorrect in our case as the main button says rate limited and so does the banner which is correct so the hover tooltips should be dynamic
- [x] ensure chips properly scale to take up the remaining space on their row without looking weird e.g Endpoint Provisioning has a ton of empty space next to it as its the only chip on that row
- [x] the adguard allowlist doesnt get setup properly and has no entries in it
- [x] ensure the adguard rewrite for our certificate thing is setup properly
- [x] test all user interactions click and toggle and login and do everything and check everything to see if everthing works update the verification suite as you go
- [x] ensure that all services mentioned in the readme properly work and show up 
- [x] write a report about your findings
- [x] clean up the repo
- [x] push and commit
