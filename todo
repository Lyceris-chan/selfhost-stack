## Documentation & Messaging

**Blocklist Information**
- [x] Add clear citation: blocklist sourced from https://github.com/Lyceris-chan/dns-blocklist-generator/
- [x] Explain it's based on Hagezi Pro++ with selected AdGuard default lists (deduplicated)
- [x] Clarify that you curated specific lists and added Easy List Dutch: https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylistdutch.txt
- [x] Note the aggressive nature and suggest users explore AdGuard's default lists as alternatives

**Port Exposure & Security**
- [x] Document that only WireGuard port 51820 is exposed
- [x] Explain that port is "invisible" without the key (use consistent wording from rest of readme)

**Split Tunneling**
- [x] Clarify that only self-hosted services route through WireGuard to preserve bandwidth
- [x] Explain benefit: streaming services (Netflix, YouTube) maintain full speed on mobile data instead of routing home first

**System Reset Warning**
- [x] Replace current text with: "REVERT: Total Cleanup ⚠️ — This erases only the parts we added. It wipes the Invidious database and any data saved inside our apps during your usage. If you didn't back up your app data, it will be gone forever. It does not touch your personal files (like your Documents or Photos folders); it only clears out our software."

**Privacy Controls**
- [x] Update Portainer analytics section: verify analytics are disabled programmatically (via curl/API) without user intervention
- [x] Clarify the method we use to toggle analytics in the README 
- [x] Ensure this works with and without -p flag

- [x] check if everything works stimulate interactions and that the layout works properly and is aligned properly strictly following m3.material.io rules for the grids spacing chips everything

## Technical Investigations

**Service Allowlisting**
- [x] Determine if ProtonVPN and Desec require allowlisting
- [x] If not required: create optional flag for ProtonVPN personal use only (browser VPN access)
- [x] If required: document in blocklist section

**NAT-PMP**
- [x] Verify if NAT-PMP (Port Forwarding) is necessary for current deployment

**Service Availability Issue**
- [x] Investigate: after a couple hours only Wikiless, Invidious, Scribe unavailable but still annoying (REMEDY: Enhanced Gluetun health checks to monitor tunnel connectivity + set all frontends to 'restart: always' to recover if VPN provider rotates/restarts)
