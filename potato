# Progress Report

## Fixed Issues
- [x] **AdGuard Configuration Error**: Fixed YAML syntax generation in `lib/services/config.sh`. `user_rules` now correctly handles empty lists.
- [x] **Hub API Permission Error**: Updated `lib/core/core.sh` to ensure `deployment.log` is writable (`chmod 666`) by the container user.
- [x] **Dashboard Console Error**: Fixed `TypeError: palette.get is not a function` in `lib/templates/assets/dashboard.js` by updating method call to `palette.tone()` to match the `material-color-utilities` library version.
- [x] **Services not showing**: Resolved by fixing Hub API permissions (allowing API startup) and Dashboard JS error (allowing frontend rendering).

## UI & Writing Improvements
- [x] **Material Design 3**: Verified CSS tokens and responsiveness.
- [x] **Writing Style**: Updated `dashboard.html` and `dashboard.js` to follow Google Developer Style Guide.
    - Removed "Please" and "We".
    - Simplified jargon (e.g., "FQDN" -> "domain name").
    - Switched to active voice where possible.
    - Standardized sentence case for headings.
