- the UI is still messed up with e.g the cross to close a dialogue appearing under the A in Admin Admin Authentication  
- ensure for the UI that we strictly adhere to m3.material.io
- ensure that the wording in the code, readme, dashboard and everywhere else follows https://developers.google.com/style and the other pages it talks about
- ensure the UI is rigoursly tested for alignment and other problems to ensure everything is proper production ready following m3.material.io rules for everything spacing etc etc
- 
- verify there arent any other problems by inspecting the browser console logs for the nginx dashboard we host and by checking the container logs for all services
- ensure we setup searxng properly following https://docs.searxng.org/admin/installation-searxng.html#configuration
- set everything to the defaults they provide and set autocomplete to google and set image proxy to on
- the domain IP link switcher doesnt work
- things like these should be in a click to copy codebox to allow easy usage
