13. Progress Monitoring: Update progress is logged in real-time to the dashboard's log view.
14. Resource Awareness: Added UI warnings informing users about increased CPU/RAM usage during update builds.
15. Wizard Removed: Completely stripped the Setup Wizard (HTML/CSS/JS) to prevent UI interference.
16. Tooltip Engine: Rewritten with M3-compliant 150ms delay and robust transition handling to prevent flickering or "stuck" tooltips.
17. Header Action Ordering: API indicator moved next to Privacy Masking; redundant arrows removed.
18. Log Expansion: Updated Log Container to use flex-grow: 1, ensuring logs occupy all available card space.
19. Informative Loading: Replaced generic "Loading..." indicators with rich M3 loading boxes featuring centered spinners and descriptive body-medium text.
20. Privacy Clarification: Renamed "Safe Display" to "Privacy Masking" throughout UI and README.
21. API Monitoring: Integrated global API status indicator in the header.
22. Syntax Integrity: Fixed recursive code duplication and missing braces.
23. Scaling Documentation: Updated README with explicit Core/Thread differentiation.
24. Advanced Network Docs: Added detailed guides for DNS Hijacking and encrypted DNS.
25. Theme Customization: Implemented dynamic M3 palette generation from seed colors and image uploads with server-side persistence.
26. Vertical Profile List: Converted WireGuard profiles to a clean vertical M3 list with icons.
27. Odido Status Fix: Resolved TypeError and added a real-time consumption graph with smoothing.
28. Settings Cog Polish: Improved visual state (0.5 opacity rest, 1.0 hover) and modal typography.
29. Metrics Logic: Fixed CPU/RAM percentage calculation in the service management modal.
30. Verification Expansion: Scaled to a 100-step comprehensive framework in VERIFICATION_100.md.
31. System Health UI: Added a dedicated card next to logs for system health (CPU, RAM, Uptime, Project Disk Space, Drive Status).
32. Backend Metrics: Integrated psutil into hub-api for robust system monitoring.
33. M3 State Layers: Refined hover/active states for buttons and chips using strict M3 opacity tokens to prevent blending.
34. API Fixed: Resolved 404/502 errors by fixing proxy paths and authentication requirements for logs and metrics.
35. Material Color Utilities: Integrated the official MCU library for accurate HCT color space palette generation.
36. Theme Switcher Sync: Updated the theme engine to dynamically regenerate palettes when toggling between dark and light modes.
37. UI Polish: Improved the Theme Customization card with an integrated M3-style color picker and image extraction interface.
38. MCU Syntax Fix: Resolved "Unexpected token 'export'" by correctly implementing ESM imports and exposing MCU globally.
39. Uniform Spacing: Standardized vertical text spacing in service cards.
40. Material Arrows: Replaced generic arrows with `arrow_forward` and added hover transform animations.
41. Metrics Relocation: Moved per-container CPU/RAM metrics to card header actions for better layout.
42. CDN VPN Proxy: Routed all external asset downloads (fonts, MCU) through Gluetun VPN proxy to protect host IP.
43. Seed Color Hex: Added real-time hex color display to the theme customization interface.
44. Drive Health Pro: Implemented SMART-based health % and intelligent issue detection with informational tooltips.
45. Technical Log Humanization: Replaced technical HTTP status logs with user-friendly system messages.
46. Console Error Scrub: Fixed all dashboard console errors including MCU, favicon, and API gateway timeouts.
47. Accurate Project Sizing: Overhauled project size calculation to include source code, base directory, and Docker volumes.
48. System Uninstaller: Added a functional "Uninstall" button with double-confirmation safeguards and background cleanup.
49. Log Scrollability: Fixed log container overflow issues by implementing robust vertical scrolling.

15-METHOD VERIFICATION FRAMEWORK:
==========================================================
[ARCHITECTURE & DEPLOYMENT]
