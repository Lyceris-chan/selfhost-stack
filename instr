MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD:
http://192.168.69.206:8081

not all logs were translated to human logs i still saw some code 200 logs improve this

im getting offline api error 
(index):2461 Uncaught ReferenceError: fetchMetrics is not defined
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> ((index):2461:118)

    at fetchStatus ((index):1676:47)
fetchStatus @ (index):1688


the dashboard shows 2 settings cog per chip and the service text is cut off
the wizard causes a blank screen on the portal
the buttons still say vpn_lock Private Instance and change the arrow to be like this ->

text is still broken for things like Private Instance arrow_forward, the arrow should be visible on both with movement on both when hovered, the settings cog should be on the most right of the chip until hover and the settings cog currently doesnt do anything, ensure none of the buttons got removed that we had before like the update and migrate ones etc 

ensure redlib is set to healthy even when these conditions are met in the log in portainer as those arent a cause for concern
