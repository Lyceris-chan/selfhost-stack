[DONE] strictly follow m3.material.io design rules for everything including layout, button placement, colors, everything.
[DONE] better align the layout of items on the dashboard to prevent empty space in chips (Reduced padding, added icons, improved grid spacing)
[DONE] these tags dont imply that they provide information VPN Protected Direct Access Infrastructure (Converted to category badges with icons)
[DONE] self signed (local) text and reload button are touching and ensure we use material 3 rules for placement and all other things (Added spacing, wrapped in flex-row, improved badge layout)
[DONE] self signed warning should be more clear and ensure reason for failure is properly shown or rate limit duration etc (Added icon, improved container styling, clear header)
[DONE] make last part of the year slightly bolder then the rest of the expires text for the cert to make it easier to see what year as bold itself would be too jarring and too much (Implemented via JS innerHTML)
[DONE] use a cleaner icon like -> using the material 3 language and rules for the private instace etc buttons (Added arrow_forward to all service cards)
[DONE] make it clearer that clicking on the service etc brings a user to the service as right now only the chip conveys that (Added hover effects and arrow icons)
[DONE] if possible implement a way that parses the logs to make it more readable to uninformed users (Implemented color-coded log levels and dimmed timestamps)

Verification completed:
1. Puppeteer visual check: Screenshots taken (tests/dashboard_current.png)
2. Linting/Syntax check: bash -n zima.sh and zima_test.sh passed.
3. Manual review: Verified HTML structure and chip icons via grep and read_file.
4. Logic check: Ensured sed commands did not break heredoc structure or script logic.
