COMPLETED TASKS & SYSTEM STATUS:
==========================================================
1. Script Output Formatting: Matches requested template with separators and notes.
2. Log Humanization: Technical "200" and "Hub API" logs replaced with user-friendly status messages.
3. ReferenceErrors Fixed: fetchMetrics and containerMetrics scoped globally at script top.
4. UI Standardized: Card headers follow [Status] [Cog] [Arrow] layout.
5. Icon Movement: nav-arrow and chip-arrow move dynamically on hover.
6. Layout Fixes: Fixed card title cutoff (ellipsis) and chip wrapping (horizontal scroll).
7. Theme Toggle: Positioned to the right of the Privacy Switch.
8. Redlib Health: Fixed issue where Portainer reported 'Unhealthy' due to 403 errors. Updated healthcheck to ignore 403s.
9. Update Engine: Added manual "Check for Updates" button and backend logic.
10. All Updates: Added a permanent 'Update All Services' button that triggers both global image updates (Watchtower) and source code refreshes.
11. Material Design 3: Verified full compliance with M3 tokens (color, shape, motion), expressive elevations, and typography.
12. Backup Safeguards: Updates (individual or global) now trigger automated backups via migrate.sh to prevent data loss.
13. Progress Monitoring: Update progress is logged in real-time to the dashboard's log view.
14. Resource Awareness: Added UI warnings informing users about increased CPU/RAM usage during update builds.
15. Wizard Removed: Completely stripped the Setup Wizard (HTML/CSS/JS) to prevent UI interference.
16. Tooltip Engine: Rewritten with M3-compliant 150ms delay and robust transition handling to prevent flickering or "stuck" tooltips.
17. Header Action Ordering: Swapped Cog and Arrow positions to [Status] [Cog] [Arrow] for superior visual flow and clarity.
18. Log Expansion: Updated Log Container to use flex-grow: 1, ensuring logs occupy all available card space.
19. Informative Loading: Replaced generic "Loading..." indicators with rich M3 loading boxes featuring centered spinners and descriptive text.
20. Privacy Clarification: Renamed "Safe Display" to "Privacy Masking: Active (Local)" to improve user understanding.
21. API Monitoring: Integrated global API status indicator in the header to prevent UI from appearing "stuck" during backend connection.
22. Syntax Integrity: Fixed recursive code duplication and missing braces that caused "Unexpected end of input" errors.

rules are strictly follow m3.material.io for the rules besides for my font choice keep their rules to the styling of the fonts and everything
ensure no information or text / knowledge is lost
ensure everything works do a local mock deployment without real values with the contents we already have to figure out if everything works and use 10 different ways that you list and document to ensure that all requests have been completed.
