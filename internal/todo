- [x] Implement dynamic grid layouts (3x3, 4x4) based on screen size, removing hardcoded service name logic
- [x] Refine chip width and spacing to strictly follow M3 Material Design auto-layout rules
- [x] Verify all UI interactions (toggles, switches, buttons) via automated testing
- [x] Audit container logs and console for errors during `-p -y` execution
- [x] Execute `zima.sh -p -y` with provided credentials (dockerhub: laciachan, WG secrets) and verify success
- [x] Inform user: Disable dynamic MAC addresses on their device to ensure firewall consistency
- [x] memory usage shows as 9 MB / 1024 MB (both sides labeled)
- [/] ensure UI elements are properly aligned (ongoing verification via Puppeteer)
- [x] dont show cpu and ram usage on the service chips (moved to settings cog/metrics)
- [x] remove 'Private Instance' text from all chips
- [x] make the trash can icon color less aggressive (dimmed surface variant)
- [x] restyle optimal badge (success-container theme, edge-aligned)
- [x] log filtering implementation (level and category filters active)
- [x] human-readable log translations (common API calls translated to plain English)
- [x] iptables rules clarification (logs specify only stack-specific rules are touched)
- [x] ensure we strictly follow m3.material.io rules (validating colors and spacing)
- [x] SIMULATE ALL INTERACTIONS: Click, toggle, and switch every UI element to verify stability
- [x] clearer update progress (snackbars and detailed logs for builds)
- [x] ensure theme sticks on restart (implementing persistent theme API)
- [x] disabling portainer telemetry (confirmed --no-analytics in compose)
- [x] color reset works as intended (fixed localStorage handling)
- [x] fix VERT URL typo in dashboard and README
- [x] implement category filter bar at top
- [x] explain DHI images in README
- [x] fix 'View in Portainer' failure logic
- [x] Make UI grid values dynamic (3x3, 4x4) and not hard-coded for service names
- [x] Ensure chips width and spacing match intelligently using M3 rules (Auto-layout based on screen size)
- [x] Add warning/instruction to disable dynamic MAC addresses for firewall reliability (Logged to user)
- [x] Audit container and console logs for any hidden failures during -p -y deployment
- [x] Use -p -y with zima.sh to test non-interactive flow and ensure no key prompts
- [x] Verify DockerHub credentials (laciachan) and WireGuard secrets are utilized correctly via environment/config without hardcoding
