- services only show when in admin view
- privacy hub icon still doesnt show properly on native zima os dashboard favicon is fine 
- settings manage is still shown as text for the portainer manage button
- ensure the portainer password is set properly as it doesnt appear to work currently
- dont show upstream images for the ones we dont build from source
- ensure project size and CPU usage are accurate as the information obtained from htop is different from what the script reports project size should show a drop down of all categories of things showing images source etc and allowing users to cleanup and manage unneeded items 
- it looks like the purge unused images button has double icons and shouldnt it say something else incase other files are ready for cleanup
